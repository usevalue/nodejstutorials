<div class="urbanhistory"><p class="has-text-align-justify" style="font-size:15px;line-height:1.5">Urban history is a field that examines the historical nature of cities and towns, and the process of urbanization. The approach is often multidisciplinary, crossing boundaries into fields like social history, architectural history, urban sociology, urban geography, business history, and archaeology. Urbanization and industrialization were popular themes for 20th-century historians, often tied to an implicit model of modernization, or the transformation of rural traditional societies.</p>

<h3>Urban Archaeology</h3>
<div class="textbox"> <p>
    <p class="has-text-align-justify" style="font-size:15px;line-height:1.5">Urban archaeology is a sub discipline of archaeology, its basics are the same as that of non-urban archaeology. However, it looks for clues about our past in cities or areas that have been developed for hundreds of years. It also plays a prominent role in new development. While many new projects go ahead without major archaeological studies, in places like New York City and Toronto, most developments only get greenlit after archaeologists have done at least a preliminary investigation. </p>
      
    <p class="has-text-align-justify" style="font-size:15px;line-height:1.5">One issue with urban archaeology, however, is that archaeologists cannot simply dig anywhere. They must be opportunists, swooping in before new construction projects to research and examine the site. Prior to a site being excavated a great deal of research about the area's history must be done to tell whether or not the site has potential to relinquish anything significant. </p>
    
    <p class="has-text-align-justify" style="font-size:15px;line-height:1.5">Until the 19th century, civilizations did not remove refuse and debris from construction sites. The refuse was largely buried, reused, or broken down until the new structure was built on top. Due to this, cities are often higher in elevation than they used to be, with the land literally raised by the debris of the past. These artifacts help tell the stories of neighborhoods and heritage in a way that nothing else can. </p>
